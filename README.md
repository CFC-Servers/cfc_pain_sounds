# [Deprecated] CFC Pain Sounds
OOF! 

## Overview
A baseline system for giving hurt sounds to different player models. "Hurt sounds" being sounds a player makes when getting hurt. Currently only supports a handful of Half-Life player models which includes combine models. The model sounds are hard coded into a table so to modify any existing sounds or add any sounds you would have to match the format of the table.

## Installation
